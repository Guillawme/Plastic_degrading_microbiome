Figure. Depiction of plastic-degrading enzymes across the global microbiome. Depicted are 11,906 enzyme hits in the ocean and 18,119 in the soil datasets, obtained by constructing HMM models of known plastic-degrading enzymes and querying them across metagenomic sequencing datasets. 10 and 9 different degradable plastic types were observed in the respective ocean and soil fractions.
