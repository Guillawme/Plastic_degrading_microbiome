## Plastic-degrading potential across the global microbiome correlates with recent pollution trends

Figure. Depiction of plastic-degrading enzymes across the global microbiome obtained by constructing HMM models of known plastic-degrading enzymes and querying them across metagenomic sequencing datasets. We observed 11,906 enzyme hits in the ocean and 18,119 in the soil datasets, that can potentially degrade 10 different plastic types, respectively.
